    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><b><div>Launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006)</div></b>

        <b>Marc Randolph</b>, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company
        
        Reed Hastings, co-founder and Executive Chairman
        Netflix was founded by <b>Marc Randolph</b> and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was acquired by Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[10] Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland.[11][12] Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[13] Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[14] Randolph admired Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship.[11] When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1998, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz.[11] When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion Home-video sales and rental industry.[11][13] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13.[13] Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure Atria.[15][13] Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles available—nearly all DVDs published.[13][16][17] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home</p>
    <p><center><b>Transition to streaming services (2007–2012)</b></center>
        In January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD.[43] The company had for some time considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a "Netflix box" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. But after witnessing how popular streaming services such as YouTube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept.[44]
        
        In February 2007, Netflix delivered its billionth DVD, a copy of Babel to a customer in Texas.[45][46] In April 2007, Netflix recruited ReplayTV founder Anthony Wood, to build a "Netflix Player" that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a television rather than a desktop or laptop.[47] Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support, which would be spun off as the digital media player product Roku.[48][49][50]
        
        In January 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[51][52][page needed] In August 2008, the Netflix database was corrupted and the company was not able to ship DVDs to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the Amazon Web Services cloud.[53] In November 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray and discontinued its sale of used DVDs.[54] In 2009, Netflix streams overtook DVD shipments.[55]
        
        On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals to 28 days after the DVDs became available for sale, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[56][57][58] In July 2010, Netflix signed a deal to stream movies of Relativity Media.[59] In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[60] On September 22, 2010, Netflix launched in Canada, its first international market.[61][62] In November 2010, Netflix began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[63]
        
        In 2010, Netflix acquired the rights to Breaking Bad, produced by Sony Pictures Television, after the show's third season, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony pushed Netflix to release Breaking Bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show's audience on AMC due to new viewers binging on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. Breaking Bad is considered the first such show to have this "Netflix effect."[64]
        
        In January 2011,<b> Netflix</b> announced agreements with several manufacturers to include branded Netflix buttons on the remote controls of devices compatible with the service, such as Blu-ray players.[65] By May 2011, Netflix had become the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America, accounting for 30% of traffic during peak hours.[66][67][68][69]
        
        On July 12, 2011,<b>Netflix</b> announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[70][71] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price.[72] On September 11, 2011, Netflix expanded to countries in Latin America.[73][74][75] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[76][77][78][79][80] On September 26, 2011, Netflix announced a content deal with DreamWorks Animation.[81] On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together, citing customer dissatisfaction with the split.[82][83]
        
        In October 2011.<b> Netflix</b>b and The CW signed a multi-year output deal for its' television shows.[84] On January 4, 2012, Netflix started its expansion to Europe, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[85] In February 2012, Netflix reached a multi-year agreement with The Weinstein Company.[86][87] In March 2012, Netflix acquired the domain name DVD.com.[88] By 2016, Netflix rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[89][90] In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[91] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tweeted that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA".[92][93] In June 2012, Netflix signed a deal with Open Road Films.[94][95]
        
        On August 23, 2012, <b>Netflix</b>band The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[96][97] In September 2012, Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films came to Netflix 90 days after premiering on Epix.[98] These included films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[99][100]
        
        On October 18, 2012, <b>Netflix</b> launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.[101][102] On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, with classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas available immediately and others available on Netflix beginning in 2016.[103] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[104][105]
        
        On January 14, 2013, <b>Netflix</b> signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs were given to Netflix shortly after deals with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. Channel programs expired.[106]
        
        For cost reasons, <b>Netflix</b> stated that it would limit its expansion in 2013,[107] adding only one new market—the Netherlands—in September of that year. This expanded its availability to 40 territories.</p>
